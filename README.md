Abstract: Electricity grids are facing challenges due to rising peak consumption from EV adoption and renewable electricity generation.  In this context, demand response offers a solution to many of the challenges, by enabling the integration of consumer side flexibility in grid management. Most current models are based off the utilisation of aggregated EVs as virtual power plants through the use of V2G enabling smart chargers. The aim of this research is to explore the potential use of unidirectional non-smart chargers to provide the same response and the difference in fleet size require to achieve this.
